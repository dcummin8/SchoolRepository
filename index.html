  <p>Dawson Cummings' analysis on Language Diversity</p>
  <h1>Intro</h1>
  <p>I chose this topic because a lot of the coworkers I work with so not speak english so it made me curious to how many households in Colorado do and don't speak english.</p>
  <h1>Hypothesis</h1>
  <p>My hypothesis is that about 92% of all homes in Colorado will have an english speaking member living in each house. </p>
  <h1>Method</h1>
  <p>I used Google sheets to analyze the data from the United States Census Bureau to analyze the numbers between which houses spoke all english, who has at least one person who speaks english, and who speaks no english at all.</p>
  <h1>Results</h1>

  <p></p>
  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p> In Colorado, there are 78.4% of household who speak only English, 11.4% who have at least one person in the house who speaks english, and 10.4% of homes that speak no english at all.
      This means that in total, 89.6% of all households in Colorado have an English Speaking member in their homes and the remaining 10.4% do not have anyone who speak any English what so ever</p>
  <h1>Khan Academy Data</h1>
  <p>Data Tools
I think the data tools are very beneficial when it comes to computing data and how it can be set up. With all of the tools that we go through in the khan academy, they make it very simple to learn the basics of calculating data and how it is stored at the same time. All of this then makes it very easy to learn how to recognize patterns to compute what the data may look like years ahead of the data that you have at that current moment just based on the increasing or decreasing patterns that you see after you compute the data. 

Big Data
	This lesson definitely emphasized the sheer amount of data that is collected in the world. It goes on to talk about how much data is collected from different scenarios and writes about the amount of storage that some of the data centers have in just one array of hard drives and how much data is actually stored in those trays. The issue that I think is interesting is how we are working on trying to process data more efficiently as there are a couple of ways that can be accomplished whether it is improving algorithms that read this data or with the use of parallel computing which I thought was interesting. 

Bias in Machine Learning
	The kinds of Bias that they talk about in this lesson were interesting. The way that they talked about facial recognition, predictive algorithms, and language translation all go together as they provide data on how each kind of bias is computed through the algorithms. The way that they talk about the criminal justice system with it assessing the risk level of each person and how likely they are to commit another crime was something that I thought was interesting on how it essentially learned a racial bias was with the criminal justice system. 

Unit Final 
	Overall I thought that I did pretty well with the unit final. I missed a question from each category but overall I think that I learned a lot from each and I think it is interesting how all three kind of intertwine with each other and how essential they all are in order to have a good database. They all can learn from each other as well and I really enjoyed the lessons that they all taught me.
