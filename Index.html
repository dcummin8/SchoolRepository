  <p>Dawson Cummings' analysis on Language Diversity</p>
  <h1>Intro</h1>
  <p>I chose this topic because a lot of the coworkers I work with so not speak english so it made me curious to how many households in Colorado do and don't speak english.</p>
  <h1>Hypothesis</h1>
  <p>My hypothesis is that about 92% of all homes in Colorado will have an english speaking member living in each house. </p>
  <h1>Method</h1>
  <p>I used Google sheets to analyze the data from the United States Census Bureau to analyze the numbers between which houses spoke all english, who has at least one person who speaks english, and who speaks no english at all.</p>
  <h1>Results</h1>

  <h1>Possible Confounding Variables</h1>
  <ul>
  <li>.</li>
  <li></li>
  <li>If the bullet point above is true, it is also possible that older games may not still run on modern hardware, and thus people will review it negatively. but the opposite argument can be made about newer games</li>
  </ul>
  <p>*The data was formatting in such a way that I could not sort by date, making it extremely difficult to just sort by year</p>
  <p>**The dataset was also to large to create graphs for so I hade to trim down the sample size from ~60,000 to around 300</p>
